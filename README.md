Homework # 4

    This game is similar to Blackjack - the goal is to make the player's number 
    equal to the computer's number. The player must click the four crystals to 
    determine their values. Each click adds the value to the player's number. 
    Player wins when the numbers are equal. Each round sets the values of the crystals.
